# correctyourpose
A machine learning project which uses javascript instead of python and uses ml5.js

ABOUT THE PROJECT
This project is a web-based application that leverages the power of p5.js for creative coding and graphics, along with ml5.js and the pre-trained PoseNet model for real-time human pose estimation. It captures video from your webcam, identifies the position of your major joints and facial features, and overlays a visual skeleton on top of the video feed.

The goal is to provide a foundation for applications that can give users real-time feedback about their posture, helping to correct common issues like slouching or forward head posture.

KEY FEATURES
Real-time Webcam Feed: Displays live video directly in the browser.

Pose Estimation: Uses the ml5.js PoseNet model to detect 17 different key body points.

Keypoint Visualization: Draws red circles over detected joints like shoulders, elbows, and knees.

Skeleton Drawing: Connects the keypoints with green lines to form a complete skeleton.
